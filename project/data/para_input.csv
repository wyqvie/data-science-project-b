5,1,CHAPTER V.
5,2,"IN WHICH A NEW SPECIES OF FUNDS, UNKNOWN TO THE MONEYED MEN, APPEARS ON"
5,3,’CHANGE
5,4,
5,5,
5,6,Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would
5,7,create a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the bet spread
5,8,"through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation"
5,9,to its members. From the club it soon got into the papers throughout
5,10,"England. The boasted “tour of the world” was talked about, disputed,"
5,11,argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama
5,12,"claim. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook"
5,13,"their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they"
5,14,"declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except"
5,15,"theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the"
5,16,"existing means of travelling. The _Times, Standard, Morning Post_, and"
5,17,"_Daily News_, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted"
5,18,Mr. Fogg’s project as madness; the _Daily Telegraph_ alone hesitatingly
5,19,"supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his"
5,20,Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the
5,21,mental aberration of its proposer.
5,22,
5,23,"Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for"
5,24,geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns
5,25,devoted to Phileas Fogg’s venture were eagerly devoured by all classes
5,26,"of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler"
5,27,"sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the"
5,28,"_Illustrated London News_ came out with his portrait, copied from a"
5,29,photograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of the _Daily Telegraph_
5,30,"even dared to say, “Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to"
5,31,pass.”
5,32,
5,33,"At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin"
5,34,"of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from"
5,35,"every point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the"
5,36,enterprise.
5,37,
5,38,"Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed"
5,39,alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the times of
5,40,"departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary"
5,41,"to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at"
5,42,"the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively"
5,43,"moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and"
5,44,"the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon"
5,45,"accomplishing his task? There were accidents to machinery, the"
5,46,"liability of trains to run off the line, collisions, bad weather, the"
5,47,blocking up by snow—were not all these against Phileas Fogg? Would he
5,48,"not find himself, when travelling by steamer in winter, at the mercy of"
5,49,the winds and fogs? Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be
5,50,two or three days behind time? But a single delay would suffice to
5,51,fatally break the chain of communication; should Phileas Fogg once
5,52,"miss, even by an hour; a steamer, he would have to wait for the next,"
5,53,and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain.
5,54,
5,55,"This article made a great deal of noise, and, being copied into all the"
5,56,"papers, seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist."
5,57,
5,58,"Everybody knows that England is the world of betting men, who are of a"
5,59,higher class than mere gamblers; to bet is in the English temperament.
5,60,"Not only the members of the Reform, but the general public, made heavy"
5,61,"wagers for or against Phileas Fogg, who was set down in the betting"
5,62,"books as if he were a race-horse. Bonds were issued, and made their"
5,63,appearance on ’Change; “Phileas Fogg bonds” were offered at par or at a
5,64,"premium, and a great business was done in them. But five days after the"
5,65,"article in the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared, the"
5,66,demand began to subside: “Phileas Fogg” declined. They were offered by
5,67,"packages, at first of five, then of ten, until at last nobody would"
5,68,"take less than twenty, fifty, a hundred!"
5,69,
5,70,"Lord Albemarle, an elderly paralytic gentleman, was now the only"
5,71,"advocate of Phileas Fogg left. This noble lord, who was fastened to his"
5,72,"chair, would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the"
5,73,"world, if it took ten years; and he bet five thousand pounds on Phileas"
5,74,Fogg. When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was
5,75,"pointed out to him, he contented himself with replying, “If the thing"
5,76,"is feasible, the first to do it ought to be an Englishman.”"
5,77,
5,78,"The Fogg party dwindled more and more, everybody was going against him,"
5,79,and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one; and a
5,80,week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of
5,81,backers at any price.
5,82,
5,83,The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine o’clock
5,84,"one evening, when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his"
5,85,hands:
5,86,
5,87,_Suez to London._
5,88,
5,89,
5,90,"ROWAN, COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, SCOTLAND YARD:"
5,91,"    I’ve found the bank robber, Phileas Fogg. Send without delay"
5,92,    warrant of arrest to Bombay.
5,93,
5,94,
5,95,"FIX, _Detective_."
5,96,
5,97,
5,98,The effect of this dispatch was instantaneous. The polished gentleman
5,99,"disappeared to give place to the bank robber. His photograph, which was"
5,100,"hung with those of the rest of the members at the Reform Club, was"
5,101,"minutely examined, and it betrayed, feature by feature, the description"
5,102,of the robber which had been provided to the police. The mysterious
5,103,"habits of Phileas Fogg were recalled; his solitary ways, his sudden"
5,104,"departure; and it seemed clear that, in undertaking a tour round the"
5,105,"world on the pretext of a wager, he had had no other end in view than"
5,106,"to elude the detectives, and throw them off his track."

10,1,CHAPTER X.
10,2,IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET OFF WITH THE LOSS OF HIS
10,3,SHOES
10,4,
10,5,
10,6,"Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, with its base"
10,7,"in the north and its apex in the south, which is called India, embraces"
10,8,"fourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon which is spread unequally"
10,9,a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls. The British
10,10,Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of
10,11,"this vast country, and has a governor-general stationed at Calcutta,"
10,12,"governors at Madras, Bombay, and in Bengal, and a lieutenant-governor"
10,13,at Agra.
10,14,
10,15,"But British India, properly so called, only embraces seven hundred"
10,16,"thousand square miles, and a population of from one hundred to one"
10,17,hundred and ten millions of inhabitants. A considerable portion of
10,18,India is still free from British authority; and there are certain
10,19,ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent. The
10,20,"celebrated East India Company was all-powerful from 1756, when the"
10,21,English first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city
10,22,"of Madras, down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection. It"
10,23,"gradually annexed province after province, purchasing them of the"
10,24,"native chiefs, whom it seldom paid, and appointed the governor-general"
10,25,"and his subordinates, civil and military. But the East India Company"
10,26,"has now passed away, leaving the British possessions in India directly"
10,27,"under the control of the Crown. The aspect of the country, as well as"
10,28,"the manners and distinctions of race, is daily changing."
10,29,
10,30,Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous methods
10,31,"of going on foot or on horseback, in palanquins or unwieldy coaches;"
10,32,"now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges, and a great"
10,33,"railway, with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its"
10,34,"route, traverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days."
10,35,This railway does not run in a direct line across India. The distance
10,36,"between Bombay and Calcutta, as the bird flies, is only from one"
10,37,thousand to eleven hundred miles; but the deflections of the road
10,38,increase this distance by more than a third.
10,39,
10,40,The general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as follows:
10,41,"Leaving Bombay, it passes through Salcette, crossing to the continent"
10,42,"opposite Tannah, goes over the chain of the Western Ghauts, runs thence"
10,43,"north-east as far as Burhampoor, skirts the nearly independent"
10,44,"territory of Bundelcund, ascends to Allahabad, turns thence eastwardly,"
10,45,"meeting the Ganges at Benares, then departs from the river a little,"
10,46,"and, descending south-eastward by Burdivan and the French town of"
10,47,"Chandernagor, has its terminus at Calcutta."
10,48,
10,49,The passengers of the “Mongolia” went ashore at half-past four p.m.; at
10,50,exactly eight the train would start for Calcutta.
10,51,
10,52,"Mr. Fogg, after bidding good-bye to his whist partners, left the"
10,53,"steamer, gave his servant several errands to do, urged it upon him to"
10,54,"be at the station promptly at eight, and, with his regular step, which"
10,55,"beat to the second, like an astronomical clock, directed his steps to"
10,56,"the passport office. As for the wonders of Bombay—its famous city hall,"
10,57,"its splendid library, its forts and docks, its bazaars, mosques,"
10,58,"synagogues, its Armenian churches, and the noble pagoda on Malabar"
10,59,"Hill, with its two polygonal towers—he cared not a straw to see them."
10,60,"He would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of Elephanta, or"
10,61,"the mysterious hypogea, concealed south-east from the docks, or those"
10,62,"fine remains of Buddhist architecture, the Kanherian grottoes of the"
10,63,island of Salcette.
10,64,
10,65,"Having transacted his business at the passport office, Phileas Fogg"
10,66,"repaired quietly to the railway station, where he ordered dinner. Among"
10,67,"the dishes served up to him, the landlord especially recommended a"
10,68,"certain giblet of “native rabbit,” on which he prided himself."
10,69,
10,70,"Mr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish, but, despite its spiced sauce,"
10,71,"found it far from palatable. He rang for the landlord, and, on his"
10,72,"appearance, said, fixing his clear eyes upon him, “Is this rabbit,"
10,73,sir?”
10,74,
10,75,"“Yes, my lord,” the rogue boldly replied, “rabbit from the jungles.”"
10,76,
10,77,“And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed?”
10,78,
10,79,"“Mew, my lord! What, a rabbit mew! I swear to you—”"
10,80,
10,81,"“Be so good, landlord, as not to swear, but remember this: cats were"
10,82,"formerly considered, in India, as sacred animals. That was a good"
10,83,time.”
10,84,
10,85,"“For the cats, my lord?”"
10,86,
10,87,“Perhaps for the travellers as well!”
10,88,
10,89,After which Mr. Fogg quietly continued his dinner. Fix had gone on
10,90,"shore shortly after Mr. Fogg, and his first destination was the"
10,91,headquarters of the Bombay police. He made himself known as a London
10,92,"detective, told his business at Bombay, and the position of affairs"
10,93,"relative to the supposed robber, and nervously asked if a warrant had"
10,94,"arrived from London. It had not reached the office; indeed, there had"
10,95,"not yet been time for it to arrive. Fix was sorely disappointed, and"
10,96,tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay
10,97,"police. This the director refused, as the matter concerned the London"
10,98,"office, which alone could legally deliver the warrant. Fix did not"
10,99,"insist, and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the"
10,100,important document; but he was determined not to lose sight of the
10,101,mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in Bombay. He did not doubt for a
10,102,"moment, any more than Passepartout, that Phileas Fogg would remain"
10,103,"there, at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive."
10,104,
10,105,"Passepartout, however, had no sooner heard his master’s orders on"
10,106,leaving the “Mongolia” than he saw at once that they were to leave
10,107,"Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris, and that the journey would be"
10,108,"extended at least as far as Calcutta, and perhaps beyond that place. He"
10,109,began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked about was not
10,110,"really in good earnest, and whether his fate was not in truth forcing"
10,111,"him, despite his love of repose, around the world in eighty days!"
10,112,
10,113,"Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, he took a"
10,114,"leisurely promenade about the streets, where crowds of people of many"
10,115,"nationalities—Europeans, Persians with pointed caps, Banyas with round"
10,116,"turbans, Sindes with square bonnets, Parsees with black mitres, and"
10,117,long-robed Armenians—were collected. It happened to be the day of a
10,118,Parsee festival. These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster—the most
10,119,"thrifty, civilised, intelligent, and austere of the East Indians, among"
10,120,whom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay—were
10,121,"celebrating a sort of religious carnival, with processions and shows,"
10,122,"in the midst of which Indian dancing-girls, clothed in rose-coloured"
10,123,"gauze, looped up with gold and silver, danced airily, but with perfect"
10,124,"modesty, to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines. It is"
10,125,needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with
10,126,"staring eyes and gaping mouth, and that his countenance was that of the"
10,127,greenest booby imaginable.
10,128,
10,129,"Unhappily for his master, as well as himself, his curiosity drew him"
10,130,"unconsciously farther off than he intended to go. At last, having seen"
10,131,"the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance, he was turning his steps"
10,132,"towards the station, when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on"
10,133,"Malabar Hill, and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its"
10,134,interior. He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to
10,135,"enter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not go in"
10,136,without first leaving their shoes outside the door. It may be said here
10,137,that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a
10,138,disregard of the practices of the native religions.
10,139,
10,140,"Passepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple tourist,"
10,141,and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation
10,142,"which everywhere met his eyes, when of a sudden he found himself"
10,143,sprawling on the sacred flagging. He looked up to behold three enraged
10,144,"priests, who forthwith fell upon him; tore off his shoes, and began to"
10,145,"beat him with loud, savage exclamations. The agile Frenchman was soon"
10,146,"upon his feet again, and lost no time in knocking down two of his"
10,147,long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of
10,148,"his toes; then, rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could"
10,149,"carry him, he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd"
10,150,in the streets.
10,151,
10,152,"At five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, and"
10,153,"having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes, rushed"
10,154,breathlessly into the station.
10,155,
10,156,"Fix, who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station, and saw that he was"
10,157,"really going to leave Bombay, was there, upon the platform. He had"
10,158,"resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta, and farther, if"
10,159,"necessary. Passepartout did not observe the detective, who stood in an"
10,160,obscure corner; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words
10,161,to Mr. Fogg.
10,162,
10,163,"“I hope that this will not happen again,” said Phileas Fogg coldly, as"
10,164,"he got into the train. Poor Passepartout, quite crestfallen, followed"
10,165,his master without a word. Fix was on the point of entering another
10,166,"carriage, when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan."
10,167,
10,168,"“No, I’ll stay,” muttered he. “An offence has been committed on Indian"
10,169,soil. I’ve got my man.”
10,170,
10,171,"Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech, and the train passed out"
10,172,into the darkness of the night.
10,173,
10,174,
10,175,
10,176,
15,1,CHAPTER XV.
15,2,IN WHICH THE BAG OF BANKNOTES DISGORGES SOME THOUSANDS OF POUNDS MORE
15,3,
15,4,
15,5,"The train entered the station, and Passepartout jumping out first, was"
15,6,"followed by Mr. Fogg, who assisted his fair companion to descend."
15,7,"Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong steamer, in"
15,8,order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the voyage. He was unwilling
15,9,to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground.
15,10,
15,11,"Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him, and"
15,12,"said, “Mr. Phileas Fogg?”"
15,13,
15,14,“I am he.”
15,15,
15,16,"“Is this man your servant?” added the policeman, pointing to"
15,17,Passepartout.
15,18,
15,19,“Yes.”
15,20,
15,21,"“Be so good, both of you, as to follow me.”"
15,22,
15,23,Mr. Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever. The policeman was a
15,24,"representative of the law, and law is sacred to an Englishman."
15,25,"Passepartout tried to reason about the matter, but the policeman tapped"
15,26,"him with his stick, and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to obey."
15,27,
15,28,“May this young lady go with us?” asked he.
15,29,
15,30,"“She may,” replied the policeman."
15,31,
15,32,"Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri, a"
15,33,"sort of four-wheeled carriage, drawn by two horses, in which they took"
15,34,their places and were driven away. No one spoke during the twenty
15,35,minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination. They first
15,36,"passed through the “black town,” with its narrow streets, its"
15,37,"miserable, dirty huts, and squalid population; then through the"
15,38,"“European town,” which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions,"
15,39,"shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts, where, although it"
15,40,"was early morning, elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages"
15,41,were passing back and forth.
15,42,
15,43,"The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house, which, however, did"
15,44,not have the appearance of a private mansion. The policeman having
15,45,"requested his prisoners—for so, truly, they might be called—to descend,"
15,46,"conducted them into a room with barred windows, and said: “You will"
15,47,appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past eight.”
15,48,
15,49,"He then retired, and closed the door."
15,50,
15,51,"“Why, we are prisoners!” exclaimed Passepartout, falling into a chair."
15,52,
15,53,"Aouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg: “Sir,"
15,54,you must leave me to my fate! It is on my account that you receive this
15,55,"treatment, it is for having saved me!”"
15,56,
15,57,Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible. It
15,58,was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee.
15,59,The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge.
15,60,"There was some mistake. Moreover, he would not, in any event, abandon"
15,61,"Aouda, but would escort her to Hong Kong."
15,62,
15,63,"“But the steamer leaves at noon!” observed Passepartout, nervously."
15,64,
15,65,"“We shall be on board by noon,” replied his master, placidly."
15,66,
15,67,It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to
15,68,"himself, “Parbleu that’s certain! Before noon we shall be on board.”"
15,69,But he was by no means reassured.
15,70,
15,71,"At half-past eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, and,"
15,72,"requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining hall. It was"
15,73,"evidently a court-room, and a crowd of Europeans and natives already"
15,74,occupied the rear of the apartment.
15,75,
15,76,Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite
15,77,"the desks of the magistrate and his clerk. Immediately after, Judge"
15,78,"Obadiah, a fat, round man, followed by the clerk, entered. He proceeded"
15,79,"to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail, and put it hurriedly on"
15,80,his head.
15,81,
15,82,"“The first case,” said he. Then, putting his hand to his head, he"
15,83,"exclaimed, “Heh! This is not my wig!”"
15,84,
15,85,"“No, your worship,” returned the clerk, “it is mine.”"
15,86,
15,87,"“My dear Mr. Oysterpuff, how can a judge give a wise sentence in a"
15,88,clerk’s wig?”
15,89,
15,90,The wigs were exchanged.
15,91,
15,92,"Passepartout was getting nervous, for the hands on the face of the big"
15,93,clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity.
15,94,
15,95,"“The first case,” repeated Judge Obadiah."
15,96,
15,97,“Phileas Fogg?” demanded Oysterpuff.
15,98,
15,99,"“I am here,” replied Mr. Fogg."
15,100,
15,101,“Passepartout?”
15,102,
15,103,"“Present,” responded Passepartout."
15,104,
15,105,"“Good,” said the judge. “You have been looked for, prisoners, for two"
15,106,days on the trains from Bombay.”
15,107,
15,108,"“But of what are we accused?” asked Passepartout, impatiently."
15,109,
15,110,“You are about to be informed.”
15,111,
15,112,"“I am an English subject, sir,” said Mr. Fogg, “and I have the right—”"
15,113,
15,114,“Have you been ill-treated?”
15,115,
15,116,“Not at all.”
15,117,
15,118,“Very well; let the complainants come in.”
15,119,
15,120,"A door was swung open by order of the judge, and three Indian priests"
15,121,entered.
15,122,
15,123,"“That’s it,” muttered Passepartout; “these are the rogues who were"
15,124,going to burn our young lady.”
15,125,
15,126,"The priests took their places in front of the judge, and the clerk"
15,127,proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against
15,128,"Phileas Fogg and his servant, who were accused of having violated a"
15,129,place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion.
15,130,
15,131,“You hear the charge?” asked the judge.
15,132,
15,133,"“Yes, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg, consulting his watch, “and I admit it.”"
15,134,
15,135,“You admit it?”
15,136,
15,137,"“I admit it, and I wish to hear these priests admit, in their turn,"
15,138,what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji.”
15,139,
15,140,The priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand what
15,141,was said.
15,142,
15,143,"“Yes,” cried Passepartout, warmly; “at the pagoda of Pillaji, where"
15,144,they were on the point of burning their victim.”
15,145,
15,146,"The judge stared with astonishment, and the priests were stupefied."
15,147,
15,148,“What victim?” said Judge Obadiah. “Burn whom? In Bombay itself?”
15,149,
15,150,“Bombay?” cried Passepartout.
15,151,
15,152,"“Certainly. We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji, but of the"
15,153,"pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay.”"
15,154,
15,155,"“And as a proof,” added the clerk, “here are the desecrator’s very"
15,156,"shoes, which he left behind him.”"
15,157,
15,158,Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk.
15,159,
15,160,"“My shoes!” cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting this"
15,161,imprudent exclamation to escape him.
15,162,
15,163,"The confusion of master and man, who had quite forgotten the affair at"
15,164,"Bombay, for which they were now detained at Calcutta, may be imagined."
15,165,
15,166,"Fix the detective, had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout’s"
15,167,"escapade gave him, and, delaying his departure for twelve hours, had"
15,168,consulted the priests of Malabar Hill. Knowing that the English
15,169,"authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour, he"
15,170,"promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward to"
15,171,Calcutta by the next train. Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of
15,172,"the young widow, Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before"
15,173,"Mr. Fogg and his servant, the magistrates having been already warned by"
15,174,a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive. Fix’s disappointment when
15,175,he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta
15,176,may be imagined. He made up his mind that the robber had stopped
15,177,somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces. For
15,178,twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety; at
15,179,"last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive,"
15,180,"accompanied by a young woman, whose presence he was wholly at a loss to"
15,181,explain. He hastened for a policeman; and this was how the party came
15,182,to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah.
15,183,
15,184,"Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied, he would have espied"
15,185,"the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room, watching the"
15,186,proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the warrant had
15,187,"failed to reach him at Calcutta, as it had done at Bombay and Suez."
15,188,
15,189,"Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout’s rash exclamation,"
15,190,which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall.
15,191,
15,192,“The facts are admitted?” asked the judge.
15,193,
15,194,"“Admitted,” replied Mr. Fogg, coldly."
15,195,
15,196,"“Inasmuch,” resumed the judge, “as the English law protects equally and"
15,197,"sternly the religions of the Indian people, and as the man Passepartout"
15,198,"has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at"
15,199,"Bombay, on the 20th of October, I condemn the said Passepartout to"
15,200,imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds.”
15,201,
15,202,"“Three hundred pounds!” cried Passepartout, startled at the largeness"
15,203,of the sum.
15,204,
15,205,“Silence!” shouted the constable.
15,206,
15,207,"“And inasmuch,” continued the judge, “as it is not proved that the act"
15,208,"was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant, and as"
15,209,the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his
15,210,"paid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week’s imprisonment and a"
15,211,fine of one hundred and fifty pounds.”
15,212,
15,213,Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be
15,214,"detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant"
15,215,to arrive. Passepartout was stupefied. This sentence ruined his master.
15,216,"A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because he, like a precious"
15,217,"fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda!"
15,218,
15,219,"Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least"
15,220,"concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being"
15,221,"pronounced. Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he rose, and"
15,222,"said, “I offer bail.”"
15,223,
15,224,"“You have that right,” returned the judge."
15,225,
15,226,"Fix’s blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he heard the"
15,227,judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one
15,228,thousand pounds.
15,229,
15,230,"“I will pay it at once,” said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills"
15,231,"from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on"
15,232,the clerk’s desk.
15,233,
15,234,"“This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison,” said"
15,235,"the judge. “Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail.”"
15,236,
15,237,“Come!” said Phileas Fogg to his servant.
15,238,
15,239,“But let them at least give me back my shoes!” cried Passepartout
15,240,angrily.
15,241,
15,242,"“Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!” he muttered, as they were handed to"
15,243,"him. “More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides, they pinch my feet.”"
15,244,
15,245,"Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by the"
15,246,crestfallen Passepartout. Fix still nourished hopes that the robber
15,247,"would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but"
15,248,"would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued forth on Mr."
15,249,"Fogg’s traces. That gentleman took a carriage, and the party were soon"
15,250,landed on one of the quays.
15,251,
15,252,"The “Rangoon” was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of"
15,253,departure hoisted at the mast-head. Eleven o’clock was striking; Mr.
15,254,Fogg was an hour in advance of time. Fix saw them leave the carriage
15,255,"and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with"
15,256,disappointment.
15,257,
15,258,"“The rascal is off, after all!” he exclaimed. “Two thousand pounds"
15,259,sacrificed! He’s as prodigal as a thief! I’ll follow him to the end of
15,260,"the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is going on, the stolen"
15,261,money will soon be exhausted.”
15,262,
15,263,The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture. Since
15,264,"leaving London, what with travelling expenses, bribes, the purchase of"
15,265,"the elephant, bails, and fines, Mr. Fogg had already spent more than"
15,266,"five thousand pounds on the way, and the percentage of the sum"
15,267,"recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives, was rapidly"
15,268,diminishing.

20,1,CHAPTER XX.
20,2,IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG
20,3,
20,4,
20,5,"While these events were passing at the opium-house, Mr. Fogg,"
20,6,"unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer, was quietly"
20,7,"escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter, making the"
20,8,necessary purchases for the long voyage before them. It was all very
20,9,well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with
20,10,a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under
20,11,"such conditions. He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity,"
20,12,"and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion, who"
20,13,was confused by his patience and generosity:
20,14,
20,15,“It is in the interest of my journey—a part of my programme.”
20,16,
20,17,"The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined at a"
20,18,"sumptuously served _table-d’hôte;_ after which Aouda, shaking hands"
20,19,"with her protector after the English fashion, retired to her room for"
20,20,rest. Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal
20,21,of the _Times_ and _Illustrated London News_.
20,22,
20,23,"Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been"
20,24,"not to see his servant return at bedtime. But, knowing that the steamer"
20,25,"was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning, he did not"
20,26,disturb himself about the matter. When Passepartout did not appear the
20,27,"next morning to answer his master’s bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying the"
20,28,"least vexation, contented himself with taking his carpet-bag, calling"
20,29,"Aouda, and sending for a palanquin."
20,30,
20,31,"It was then eight o’clock; at half-past nine, it being then high tide,"
20,32,the “Carnatic” would leave the harbour. Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the
20,33,"palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow, and half"
20,34,an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark. Mr.
20,35,Fogg then learned that the “Carnatic” had sailed the evening before. He
20,36,"had expected to find not only the steamer, but his domestic, and was"
20,37,forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his
20,38,"face, and he merely remarked to Aouda, “It is an accident, madam;"
20,39,nothing more.”
20,40,
20,41,At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached.
20,42,"It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr. Fogg: “Were you not, like me,"
20,43,"sir, a passenger by the ‘Rangoon,’ which arrived yesterday?”"
20,44,
20,45,"“I was, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg coldly. “But I have not the honour—”"
20,46,
20,47,“Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here.”
20,48,
20,49,"“Do you know where he is, sir?” asked Aouda anxiously."
20,50,
20,51,"“What!” responded Fix, feigning surprise. “Is he not with you?”"
20,52,
20,53,"“No,” said Aouda. “He has not made his appearance since yesterday."
20,54,Could he have gone on board the ‘Carnatic’ without us?”
20,55,
20,56,"“Without you, madam?” answered the detective. “Excuse me, did you"
20,57,intend to sail in the ‘Carnatic’?”
20,58,
20,59,"“Yes, sir.”"
20,60,
20,61,"“So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed. The ‘Carnatic’,"
20,62,"its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the"
20,63,"stated time, without any notice being given; and we must now wait a"
20,64,week for another steamer.”
20,65,
20,66,As he said “a week” Fix felt his heart leap for joy. Fogg detained at
20,67,"Hong Kong for a week! There would be time for the warrant to arrive,"
20,68,and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law. His horror
20,69,"may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say, in his placid voice, “But"
20,70,"there are other vessels besides the ‘Carnatic,’ it seems to me, in the"
20,71,harbour of Hong Kong.”
20,72,
20,73,"And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward the docks"
20,74,"in search of some craft about to start. Fix, stupefied, followed; it"
20,75,seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread.
20,76,"Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the man it had"
20,77,hitherto served so well. For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about
20,78,"the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to"
20,79,carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were
20,80,"loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail. Fix began"
20,81,to hope again.
20,82,
20,83,"But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search,"
20,84,"resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted"
20,85,by a sailor on one of the wharves.
20,86,
20,87,“Is your honour looking for a boat?”
20,88,
20,89,“Have you a boat ready to sail?”
20,90,
20,91,"“Yes, your honour; a pilot-boat—No. 43—the best in the harbour.”"
20,92,
20,93,“Does she go fast?”
20,94,
20,95,“Between eight and nine knots the hour. Will you look at her?”
20,96,
20,97,“Yes.”
20,98,
20,99,“Your honour will be satisfied with her. Is it for a sea excursion?”
20,100,
20,101,“No; for a voyage.”
20,102,
20,103,“A voyage?”
20,104,
20,105,"“Yes, will you agree to take me to Yokohama?”"
20,106,
20,107,"The sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and said, “Is"
20,108,your honour joking?”
20,109,
20,110,"“No. I have missed the ‘Carnatic,’ and I must get to Yokohama by the"
20,111,"14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco.”"
20,112,
20,113,"“I am sorry,” said the sailor; “but it is impossible.”"
20,114,
20,115,"“I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward of two"
20,116,hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time.”
20,117,
20,118,“Are you in earnest?”
20,119,
20,120,“Very much so.”
20,121,
20,122,"The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea,"
20,123,evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the
20,124,fear of venturing so far. Fix was in mortal suspense.
20,125,
20,126,"Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, “You would not be afraid, would"
20,127,"you, madam?”"
20,128,
20,129,"“Not with you, Mr. Fogg,” was her answer."
20,130,
20,131,"The pilot now returned, shuffling his hat in his hands."
20,132,
20,133,"“Well, pilot?” said Mr. Fogg."
20,134,
20,135,"“Well, your honour,” replied he, “I could not risk myself, my men, or"
20,136,my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time
20,137,"of year. Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is"
20,138,sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong.”
20,139,
20,140,"“Only sixteen hundred,” said Mr. Fogg."
20,141,
20,142,“It’s the same thing.”
20,143,
20,144,Fix breathed more freely.
20,145,
20,146,"“But,” added the pilot, “it might be arranged another way.”"
20,147,
20,148,Fix ceased to breathe at all.
20,149,
20,150,“How?” asked Mr. Fogg.
20,151,
20,152,"“By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to"
20,153,"Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here. In going to"
20,154,"Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast,"
20,155,"which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and"
20,156,would aid us.”
20,157,
20,158,"“Pilot,” said Mr. Fogg, “I must take the American steamer at Yokohama,"
20,159,and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.”
20,160,
20,161,“Why not?” returned the pilot. “The San Francisco steamer does not
20,162,"start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts"
20,163,from Shanghai.”
20,164,
20,165,“You are sure of that?”
20,166,
20,167,“Perfectly.”
20,168,
20,169,“And when does the boat leave Shanghai?”
20,170,
20,171,"“On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four days"
20,172,"before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good"
20,173,"luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those"
20,174,eight hundred miles to Shanghai.”
20,175,
20,176,“And you could go—”
20,177,
20,178,“In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails
20,179,put up.”
20,180,
20,181,“It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?”
20,182,
20,183,"“Yes; John Bunsby, master of the ‘Tankadere.’”"
20,184,
20,185,“Would you like some earnest-money?”
20,186,
20,187,“If it would not put your honour out—”
20,188,
20,189,"“Here are two hundred pounds on account sir,” added Phileas Fogg,"
20,190,"turning to Fix, “if you would like to take advantage—”"
20,191,
20,192,"“Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour.”"
20,193,
20,194,“Very well. In half an hour we shall go on board.”
20,195,
20,196,"“But poor Passepartout?” urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by the"
20,197,servant’s disappearance.
20,198,
20,199,"“I shall do all I can to find him,” replied Phileas Fogg."
20,200,
20,201,"While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat,"
20,202,the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong.
20,203,"Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout’s description, and left a sum of"
20,204,money to be spent in the search for him. The same formalities having
20,205,"been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having"
20,206,"stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there,"
20,207,they returned to the wharf.
20,208,
20,209,"It was now three o’clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on"
20,210,"board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure."
20,211,
20,212,"The “Tankadere” was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully"
20,213,"built as if she were a racing yacht. Her shining copper sheathing, her"
20,214,"galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride"
20,215,taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable. Her two masts leaned a
20,216,"trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and"
20,217,"standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she"
20,218,"seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by"
20,219,gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races. The crew of the “Tankadere”
20,220,"was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who"
20,221,"were familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby, himself, a man of"
20,222,"forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly"
20,223,"expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance,"
20,224,would have inspired confidence in the most timid.
20,225,
20,226,"Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already"
20,227,"installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out"
20,228,"in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table"
20,229,"provided with a swinging lamp. The accommodation was confined, but"
20,230,neat.
20,231,
20,232,"“I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you,” said Mr. Fogg to Fix,"
20,233,who bowed without responding.
20,234,
20,235,The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the
20,236,kindness of Mr. Fogg.
20,237,
20,238,"“It’s certain,” thought he, “though rascal as he is, he is a polite"
20,239,one!”
20,240,
20,241,The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three.
20,242,"Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the"
20,243,"quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. Fix was not without his"
20,244,"fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant,"
20,245,"whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an"
20,246,explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have
20,247,"ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still"
20,248,lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.
20,249,
20,250,"John Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the"
20,251,"“Tankadere,” taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, and"
20,252,"standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves."

22,1,CHAPTER XXII.
22,2,"IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT FINDS OUT THAT, EVEN AT THE ANTIPODES, IT IS"
22,3,CONVENIENT TO HAVE SOME MONEY IN ONE’S POCKET
22,4,
22,5,
22,6,"The “Carnatic,” setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six on the 7th"
22,7,"of November, directed her course at full steam towards Japan. She"
22,8,carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers. Two
22,9,"state-rooms in the rear were, however, unoccupied—those which had been"
22,10,engaged by Phileas Fogg.
22,11,
22,12,"The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye, staggering gait,"
22,13,"and disordered hair, was seen to emerge from the second cabin, and to"
22,14,totter to a seat on deck.
22,15,
22,16,It was Passepartout; and what had happened to him was as follows:
22,17,"Shortly after Fix left the opium den, two waiters had lifted the"
22,18,"unconscious Passepartout, and had carried him to the bed reserved for"
22,19,"the smokers. Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams by a fixed"
22,20,"idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the stupefying"
22,21,influence of the narcotic. The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off
22,22,"his torpor, and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness. Staggering"
22,23,"and holding himself up by keeping against the walls, falling down and"
22,24,"creeping up again, and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct, he"
22,25,"kept crying out, “The ‘Carnatic!’ the ‘Carnatic!’”"
22,26,
22,27,"The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of starting."
22,28,"Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon the plank, he"
22,29,"crossed it, and fell unconscious on the deck, just as the “Carnatic”"
22,30,"was moving off. Several sailors, who were evidently accustomed to this"
22,31,"sort of scene, carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin,"
22,32,and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty
22,33,miles away from China. Thus he found himself the next morning on the
22,34,"deck of the “Carnatic,” and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating"
22,35,"sea-breeze. The pure air sobered him. He began to collect his sense,"
22,36,which he found a difficult task; but at last he recalled the events of
22,37,"the evening before, Fix’s revelation, and the opium-house."
22,38,
22,39,"“It is evident,” said he to himself, “that I have been abominably"
22,40,"drunk! What will Mr. Fogg say? At least I have not missed the steamer,"
22,41,which is the most important thing.”
22,42,
22,43,"Then, as Fix occurred to him: “As for that rascal, I hope we are well"
22,44,"rid of him, and that he has not dared, as he proposed, to follow us on"
22,45,"board the “Carnatic.” A detective on the track of Mr. Fogg, accused of"
22,46,robbing the Bank of England! Pshaw! Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than I
22,47,am a murderer.”
22,48,
22,49,Should he divulge Fix’s real errand to his master? Would it do to tell
22,50,the part the detective was playing? Would it not be better to wait
22,51,"until Mr. Fogg reached London again, and then impart to him that an"
22,52,agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the
22,53,"world, and have a good laugh over it? No doubt; at least, it was worth"
22,54,"considering. The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg, and apologise"
22,55,for his singular behaviour.
22,56,
22,57,"Passepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the rolling"
22,58,"of the steamer, to the after-deck. He saw no one who resembled either"
22,59,"his master or Aouda. “Good!” muttered he; “Aouda has not got up yet,"
22,60,and Mr. Fogg has probably found some partners at whist.”
22,61,
22,62,He descended to the saloon. Mr. Fogg was not there. Passepartout had
22,63,"only, however, to ask the purser the number of his master’s state-room."
22,64,The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of
22,65,Fogg.
22,66,
22,67,"“I beg your pardon,” said Passepartout persistently. “He is a tall"
22,68,"gentleman, quiet, and not very talkative, and has with him a young"
22,69,lady—”
22,70,
22,71,"“There is no young lady on board,” interrupted the purser. “Here is a"
22,72,list of the passengers; you may see for yourself.”
22,73,
22,74,"Passepartout scanned the list, but his master’s name was not upon it."
22,75,All at once an idea struck him.
22,76,
22,77,“Ah! am I on the ‘Carnatic?’”
22,78,
22,79,“Yes.”
22,80,
22,81,“On the way to Yokohama?”
22,82,
22,83,“Certainly.”
22,84,
22,85,Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat;
22,86,"but, though he was really on the “Carnatic,” his master was not there."
22,87,
22,88,He fell thunderstruck on a seat. He saw it all now. He remembered that
22,89,"the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed his"
22,90,"master of that fact, and that he had not done so. It was his fault,"
22,91,"then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer. Yes, but it was"
22,92,"still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate him from"
22,93,"his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into"
22,94,getting drunk! He now saw the detective’s trick; and at this moment Mr.
22,95,"Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps"
22,96,arrested and imprisoned! At this thought Passepartout tore his hair.
22,97,"Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of accounts"
22,98,there would be!
22,99,
22,100,"After his first depression, Passepartout became calmer, and began to"
22,101,study his situation. It was certainly not an enviable one. He found
22,102,"himself on the way to Japan, and what should he do when he got there?"
22,103,"His pocket was empty; he had not a solitary shilling, not so much as a"
22,104,penny. His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance; and he had
22,105,five or six days in which to decide upon his future course. He fell to
22,106,"at meals with an appetite, and ate for Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and himself. He"
22,107,"helped himself as generously as if Japan were a desert, where nothing"
22,108,to eat was to be looked for.
22,109,
22,110,At dawn on the 13th the “Carnatic” entered the port of Yokohama. This
22,111,"is an important port of call in the Pacific, where all the"
22,112,"mail-steamers, and those carrying travellers between North America,"
22,113,"China, Japan, and the Oriental islands put in. It is situated in the"
22,114,"bay of Yeddo, and at but a short distance from that second capital of"
22,115,"the Japanese Empire, and the residence of the Tycoon, the civil"
22,116,"Emperor, before the Mikado, the spiritual Emperor, absorbed his office"
22,117,"in his own. The “Carnatic” anchored at the quay near the custom-house,"
22,118,in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations.
22,119,
22,120,Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the
22,121,"Sons of the Sun. He had nothing better to do than, taking chance for"
22,122,"his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama. He"
22,123,"found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter, the houses"
22,124,"having low fronts, and being adorned with verandas, beneath which he"
22,125,"caught glimpses of neat peristyles. This quarter occupied, with its"
22,126,"streets, squares, docks, and warehouses, all the space between the"
22,127,"“promontory of the Treaty” and the river. Here, as at Hong Kong and"
22,128,"Calcutta, were mixed crowds of all races, Americans and English,"
22,129,"Chinamen and Dutchmen, mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything."
22,130,The Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had
22,131,dropped down in the midst of Hottentots.
22,132,
22,133,"He had, at least, one resource,—to call on the French and English"
22,134,consuls at Yokohama for assistance. But he shrank from telling the
22,135,"story of his adventures, intimately connected as it was with that of"
22,136,"his master; and, before doing so, he determined to exhaust all other"
22,137,"means of aid. As chance did not favour him in the European quarter, he"
22,138,"penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese, determined, if"
22,139,"necessary, to push on to Yeddo."
22,140,
22,141,"The Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten, after the goddess of"
22,142,"the sea, who is worshipped on the islands round about. There"
22,143,"Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves, sacred gates of a"
22,144,"singular architecture, bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and"
22,145,"reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees, holy retreats where were"
22,146,"sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius, and interminable"
22,147,"streets, where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked"
22,148,"children, who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens,"
22,149,and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish
22,150,"cats, might have been gathered."
22,151,
22,152,The streets were crowded with people. Priests were passing in
22,153,"processions, beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house"
22,154,officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres
22,155,"hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue cotton with white stripes,"
22,156,"and bearing guns; the Mikado’s guards, enveloped in silken doubles,"
22,157,hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all
22,158,ranks—for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it
22,159,is despised in China—went hither and thither in groups and pairs.
22,160,"Passepartout saw, too, begging friars, long-robed pilgrims, and simple"
22,161,"civilians, with their warped and jet-black hair, big heads, long busts,"
22,162,"slender legs, short stature, and complexions varying from copper-colour"
22,163,"to a dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese, from whom the"
22,164,Japanese widely differ. He did not fail to observe the curious
22,165,"equipages—carriages and palanquins, barrows supplied with sails, and"
22,166,litters made of bamboo; nor the women—whom he thought not especially
22,167,"handsome—who took little steps with their little feet, whereon they"
22,168,"wore canvas shoes, straw sandals, and clogs of worked wood, and who"
22,169,"displayed tight-looking eyes, flat chests, teeth fashionably blackened,"
22,170,"and gowns crossed with silken scarfs, tied in an enormous knot behind"
22,171,an ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from
22,172,the dames of Japan.
22,173,
22,174,Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley
22,175,"crowd, looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops, the"
22,176,"jewellery establishments glittering with quaint Japanese ornaments, the"
22,177,"restaurants decked with streamers and banners, the tea-houses, where"
22,178,"the odorous beverage was being drunk with “saki,” a liquor concocted"
22,179,"from the fermentation of rice, and the comfortable smoking-houses,"
22,180,"where they were puffing, not opium, which is almost unknown in Japan,"
22,181,"but a very fine, stringy tobacco. He went on till he found himself in"
22,182,"the fields, in the midst of vast rice plantations. There he saw"
22,183,"dazzling camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving"
22,184,"forth their last colours and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and"
22,185,"within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the"
22,186,"Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and"
22,187,"which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from the"
22,188,"sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other voracious birds. On the branches"
22,189,of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the
22,190,"weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every"
22,191,"hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes,"
22,192,"which the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise"
22,193,long life and prosperity.
22,194,
22,195,"As he was strolling along, Passepartout espied some violets among the"
22,196,shrubs.
22,197,
22,198,“Good!” said he; “I’ll have some supper.”
22,199,
22,200,"But, on smelling them, he found that they were odourless."
22,201,
22,202,"“No chance there,” thought he."
22,203,
22,204,The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a
22,205,"breakfast as possible before leaving the “Carnatic;” but, as he had"
22,206,"been walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming"
22,207,importunate. He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither
22,208,"mutton, goat, nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege to"
22,209,"kill cattle, which are preserved solely for farming, he made up his"
22,210,mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama—nor was he mistaken;
22,211,"and, in default of butcher’s meat, he could have wished for a quarter"
22,212,"of wild boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails, some game or fish,"
22,213,"which, with rice, the Japanese eat almost exclusively. But he found it"
22,214,"necessary to keep up a stout heart, and to postpone the meal he craved"
22,215,"till the following morning. Night came, and Passepartout re-entered the"
22,216,"native quarter, where he wandered through the streets, lit by"
22,217,"vari-coloured lanterns, looking on at the dancers, who were executing"
22,218,"skilful steps and boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open"
22,219,"air with their telescopes. Then he came to the harbour, which was lit"
22,220,"up by the resin torches of the fishermen, who were fishing from their"
22,221,boats.
22,222,
22,223,"The streets at last became quiet, and the patrol, the officers of"
22,224,"which, in their splendid costumes, and surrounded by their suites,"
22,225,"Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors, succeeded the bustling"
22,226,"crowd. Each time a company passed, Passepartout chuckled, and said to"
22,227,himself: “Good! another Japanese embassy departing for Europe!”
22,228,
22,229,
22,230,
22,231,
